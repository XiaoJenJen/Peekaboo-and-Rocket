Yafei Xu is working on this.

## This is a personal website of Peekaboo and Rocket! You can visit the website by clicking the [WebsiteLink](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~yafeixu/index.html).

### Peekaboo and Rocket are my two cats and we have been together for a long time. This website is built to show their interesting lives with galleries of pictures and funny diaries. The main page displays the self introduction from Peekaboo and Rocket, and the diaries of interesting things happened to them. By clicking the navbar link, you can see the subpage showing the gallery of funny pictures of Peekaboo and Rocket respectively.

### This website is built with html5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and mostly bootstrap3 and bootstrap4. I used bootstrap3 for the galleries page and bootstrap4 for the main page. Bootstrap3 is used because I am used to using bootstrap3 to make gallery of images. This website is hosted by U of A server.
